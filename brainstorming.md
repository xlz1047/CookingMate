## Top 3 Ideas Evaluation

### 1. CookingMate

- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for accessing the AI chatbot and recipes while actively cooking in the kitchen. Users get real-time recipe suggestions through conversational interaction and can reference detailed instructions hands-free while preparing meals.

- **Story:** Eliminates the daily "What should I cook?" decision fatigue by making recipe discovery conversational. Instead of scrolling through endless recipe websites, users simply ask the AI and get immediate suggestions with full cooking details including ingredients and step-by-step instructions.

- **Market:** Anyone who cooks at home could utilize this app - approximately 70% of adults cook regularly. Appeals to busy professionals needing quick dinner ideas, college students learning to cook, and home cooks looking for meal inspiration.

- **Habit:** Users interact with the chatbot multiple times per week when planning meals. They use the app during active cooking to reference ingredient lists and follow step-by-step instructions, making it a regular kitchen companion.

- **Scope:** V1 focuses on two core screens: AI chatbot for recipe discovery and recipe detail view with ingredients/steps tabs. This is clearly defined and buildable. V2 could add recipe saving to a personal collection. V3 could incorporate search and filtering. V4 could add serving adjustment and sharing features. The simplified V1 scope is very achievable within our timeline.

### 2. FitTrack AI

- **Mobile:** Mobile is useful for tracking workouts on-the-go and logging exercises at the gym. Users can view their workout history and get AI-generated workout suggestions.

- **Story:** Helps fitness enthusiasts and beginners stay consistent with personalized workout plans. Removes the guesswork from fitness routines by providing AI-tailored suggestions based on goals and progress.

- **Market:** Fitness enthusiasts and people starting their fitness journey. Large market but highly competitive with established players like MyFitnessPal, Strava, and Nike Training Club.

- **Habit:** Users would open the app several times per week during workout sessions. Primarily consumption-based (following workout plans) rather than creation. Requires user discipline to maintain habit.

- **Scope:** V1 would allow users to chat with AI for workout suggestions and log exercises. V2 adds workout history tracking. V3 incorporates progress charts and goals. V4 adds social features. Technically complex with integration of exercise databases and tracking systems.

### 3. StudyBuddy

- **Mobile:** Mobile allows students to quickly ask homework questions on-the-go and get study reminders. However, most functionality could work equally well on a website or desktop application.

- **Story:** Helps students get unstuck on homework problems and plan study sessions. However, raises ethical concerns about academic integrity and potentially enabling cheating rather than genuine learning.

- **Market:** Large student market (K-12 and college) but usage is seasonal based on academic calendar. Competitive landscape includes Chegg, Khan Academy, and Photomath with established user bases.

- **Habit:** Frequent use during school year when homework is due. Usage drops to near zero during summer and breaks. Primarily consumption-based (getting answers) without much content creation from users.

- **Scope:** V1 would allow students to ask AI questions and get explanations. V2 adds study planning features. V3 incorporates progress tracking. V4 adds flashcard creation. Technically challenging to ensure AI gives helpful guidance without simply providing answers. Requires extensive subject matter expertise.

## Final Decision

**Winner: CookingMate**

CookingMate is the strongest choice because:

1. **Mobile-first experience**: Essential for real-time recipe discovery while cooking in the kitchen and referencing instructions hands-free during meal preparation

5. **Achievable scope**: Clear, simple V1 with just two screens (chat + recipe detail) that delivers immediate value and is technically feasible within our timeline
6. **Year-round relevance**: Unlike fitness apps with seasonal usage or study apps tied to academic calendars, cooking is a consistent daily need
7. **Low complexity**: No database required for MVP, no ethical concerns, straightforward API integrations
8. **Clear differentiation**: AI-first conversational approach differentiates from traditional recipe apps with endless scrolling
