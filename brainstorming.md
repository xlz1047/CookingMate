## Top 3 Ideas Evaluation

### 1. CookingMate

- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for accessing the AI chatbot and recipes while actively cooking in the kitchen. Users get real-time recipe suggestions and can reference saved recipes when grocery shopping or meal planning away from home.

- **Story:** Eliminates the daily "What should I cook?" decision fatigue by making recipe discovery conversational. Instead of scrolling through endless recipe websites, users simply ask the AI and build a personal collection of favorites over time.

- **Market:** Anyone who cooks at home could utilize this app - approximately 70% of adults cook regularly. Appeals to busy professionals needing quick dinner ideas, college students learning to cook, and home cooks organizing recipes.

- **Habit:** Users interact with the chatbot multiple times per week when planning meals. They constantly build and reference their recipe book, making it a regular kitchen companion.

- **Scope:** V1 allows users to chat with AI for recipe suggestions and view recipe details. V2 adds ability to save recipes to personal recipe book with search. V3 incorporates filtering and sorting. V4 adds serving adjustment and sharing features.

### 2. FitTrack AI

- **Mobile:** Mobile is useful for tracking workouts on-the-go and logging exercises at the gym. Users can view their workout history and get AI-generated workout suggestions.

- **Story:** Helps fitness enthusiasts and beginners stay consistent with personalized workout plans. Removes the guesswork from fitness routines by providing AI-tailored suggestions based on goals and progress.

- **Market:** Fitness enthusiasts and people starting their fitness journey. Large market but highly competitive with established players like MyFitnessPal, Strava, and Nike Training Club.

- **Habit:** Users would open the app several times per week during workout sessions. Primarily consumption-based (following workout plans) rather than creation. Requires user discipline to maintain habit.

- **Scope:** V1 would allow users to chat with AI for workout suggestions and log exercises. V2 adds workout history tracking. V3 incorporates progress charts and goals. V4 adds social features. Technically complex with integration of exercise databases and tracking systems.

### 3. StudyBuddy

- **Mobile:** Mobile allows students to quickly ask homework questions on-the-go and get study reminders. However, most functionality could work equally well on a website or desktop application.

- **Story:** Helps students get unstuck on homework problems and plan study sessions. However, raises ethical concerns about academic integrity and potentially enabling cheating rather than genuine learning.

- **Market:** Large student market (K-12 and college) but usage is seasonal based on academic calendar. Competitive landscape includes Chegg, Khan Academy, and Photomath with established user bases.

- **Habit:** Frequent use during school year when homework is due. Usage drops to near zero during summer and breaks. Primarily consumption-based (getting answers) without much content creation from users.

- **Scope:** V1 would allow students to ask AI questions and get explanations. V2 adds study planning features. V3 incorporates progress tracking. V4 adds flashcard creation. Technically challenging to ensure AI gives helpful guidance without simply providing answers. Requires extensive subject matter expertise.

## Final Decision

**Winner: CookingMate**

CookingMate is the strongest choice because:

1. **Mobile-first experience**: Essential for real-time recipe discovery while cooking in the kitchen and accessing recipes on-the-go
2. **Compelling story**: Solves a universal daily problem everyone faces - meal planning and recipe discovery
3. **Large, well-defined market**: 70% of adults cook regularly with broad demographic appeal
4. **Strong habit potential**: Multiple uses per week for meal planning with constantly growing recipe collection
5. **Achievable scope**: Clear V1-V4 progression with technically feasible MVP (AI chat + recipe book)

The app differentiates itself through conversational AI discovery rather than endless scrolling, and the two core features (chatbot and recipe book) create immediate value while remaining buildable within our timeline. Unlike fitness or study apps, cooking is a universal, year-round activity with less ethical complexity and fewer established competitors in the AI-first space.
